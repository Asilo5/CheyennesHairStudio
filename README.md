# Cheyenne Hair Studio 

Cheyenne Hair Studio was a practice project inspired by my friend Cheyenne who is a hair stylist. I wanted to make a page for her and show off the hair styles and colours she has created throughout her career. I wanted the website to express how colourful and fun she is as a person, so the user could be more intriguied into booking her for their next hair style.
